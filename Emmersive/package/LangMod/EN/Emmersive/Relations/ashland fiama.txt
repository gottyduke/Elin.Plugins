ashland+fiama
Fellow Shadows of Mysilia, Ashland and Fiama are close companions and travel partners due to having grown up together after their adoption by Lord Cetrus. 
Their relationship status is a mystery, despite people's assumptions. 
Fiama considers Ashland to be incredibly dense about matters of the heart, which probably doesn't lend credence to rumors about anything lovey-dovey between them.
