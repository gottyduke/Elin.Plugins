A young Norland assassin known as a Shadow of Mysilia, a city where humans and Elea live in harmony. 
Fiama is aloof due to a poor and aloof childhood, attributing her survival to the goodwill of a man she met by chance. 
Naturally distrustful of humans, she prefers the company of fellow outcasts and the Elean community that took her in. 
She has an inexplicable affinity for nature, and often attracts a menagerie of wildlife to befriend without even trying.
She suffers from a strange condition that causes her to see through the eyes of others as she sleeps, or even their past or future memories, but isn't sure how to describe it to others.
