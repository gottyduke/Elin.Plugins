Ashland is a passing acquaintance of Wini, crossing paths on occasion during their travels across North Tyris.
While Ashland's affinity for magic is dismal compared to hers, they have a shared interest in botany, and he has jokes to say about her compulsion to buy more flower planters than she can carry.
